            <p class="scatter-intro">Why do so many memoirs take such a traditional approach to dealings with time instead of connecting to the real fragmentation of memories?</p>
            <p class="body-text"><br>Events are fractured and reconstructed like a shattered mirror, and in the interstices are research, meditation, flash forwards, or flashbacks, an associative development through ideas geared towards meaning making, not an arbitrary chronology.
                <br><br>We humans are not merely a sum of our memories, the way many of us have come to understand our identity, but instead we are, each of us, artists, forever in the process of recreating our identity anew. 
                <br><br>Heidegger believed that more fundamental to our sense of being-in-the-world than chronology, indeed than anything else, is what we care about and how our care is manifested. 
                <br><br>Our chronological order goes:
                <br><br>I was born,
                <br>I lived,
                <br>and eventually
                <br>I will die.
