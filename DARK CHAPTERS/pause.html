            <p class="pause-intro">Is there a difference in the quality or quantity of that white space in a piece, and what it indicates about the text?</p>
            <p class="body-text"><br>Essays that use a lot of white space are often described as fragmented. But Robert Root uses the term “segmented essay” or “segment,” as opposed to “fragment,” in his lecture “This Is What the Spaces Say,”
                <br><br>Segment comes from the Latin secare, “to cut,” while fragment is from frangere, “to break.” Both suggest separate pieces.
                <br><br>But what is the role of agency in each?
                <br><br>Is there more of a surgical intent in cutting your writing into segments?
                <br><br>Is breaking more violent –<br>to be ripped, shattered –<br>A torn form for the torn identity”?
                <br><br>And who does the breaking –<br>the author?
                <br><br>Or is the content already broken, and the brokenness is just being represented?
                <br><br>It is this –<br>the way they’re separated, and how we characterize the energy of that separation –<br>that gets at how white space is operating here.
                <br><br>Joanna Eleftheriou demonstrates how the need for naming the “lyric essay” made it possible to theorize about the form and its features,

Remaining faithful to the impossibility of representation permits the lyric essay, also, to convey the experience of the victim, whose violation often causes a rupture between self and world.”</div>
