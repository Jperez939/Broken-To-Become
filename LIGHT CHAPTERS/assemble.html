                <br><br>Every act of layering becomes a negotiation between what’s kept and what’s erased.
                <br><br>He explains how digital montage transforms collage from a single plane of assembly into a space of multiplicity.
                <br><br>Layers in Photoshop or any editing tool are not merely stacked—they communicate, interact, and create hybrid meanings. He likens digital montage to “thinking in multiple frames,” a method of holding contradictions together.
                <br><br>This reflects the tension between brokenness and reconstruction—exactly your theme of shards reassembled into coherence.
