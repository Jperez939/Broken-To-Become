            <p class="intro">How do aesthetics of repair may suggest both restoration and fragility?</p>
            <p class="body-text"><br>Susie Campbell considers the emergence, within her own and others’ artistic practice, of an alternative approach: a practice of retaining damage, or at least making any repair visible.
                <br><br>Her work is primarily text-based but she also engages directly with fabric, making textile poetry which incorporates text.
                <br><br>She shows how, over the course of several projects, she has found a set of highly suggestive similarities or material kinships between text and textile on which to base a poetics as well as thematic concerns.
                <br><br>Visible holes, stains, darns and patches tend to appear across the surface of both her text and textile-based forms. She teases out what this might mean for an aesthetics of repair and considers whether all damage can or should be mended.
                <br><br>When it came to mending the tear, she found the repair itself created a hitch in the cloth, a scar that defaced and obscured the surface of both text and textile. The repair works up to a point. It recreates a ‘page’ on which some of the text can still be read and the function of the garment is returned to plausibility.
                <br><br>Susie quotes Kate Siklosi:
